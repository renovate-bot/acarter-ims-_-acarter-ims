Document of this serves as a hands-on manual for performing issue and pull request triage for the project's issues on this service[^1], the primary objective of triage is to expedite issue management and provide faster responses to community members.

Issues and PRs triage involves three key steps:

1. assigning one or more process labels, such as “needs design” or “help wanted”;
2. marking a priority for each issue;
3. labeling one or more relevant areas, languages, or integrations to facilitate issue routing to the appropriate contributors or reviewers;

Purpose of this guide is to outline the labels used in each of these steps and provide instructions on how to apply them effectively.

Everything that is not specified in the further file, but should have been in the order of its content, should be taken from these instances (with the exception of specific labels, etc.):
