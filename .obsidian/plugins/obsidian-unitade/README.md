<!-- ABOUT PROJECT:

About the project
-----------------

Unfortunately, Obsidian™ does not, for some reason, have the ability to edit any file extensions that the user would like to edit, and the plugins that exist for this application are an inconvenient format for the end user, for example, entering a full-fledged JSON in one line.

Plugin UNITADE (or formerly named as “anything as markdown”) fixes this problem and with a simple input, it allows you to edit any extensions you enter in the settings.

<!-- BUILT WITH:
 -->
    
### Built-with

Usage

Usage of UNITADE plugin is very easy and comfortable for common user, by default, you can edit any plain text (.TXT) files in your vault, but if you want to add custom extensions, you can easy do it with plugin's settings, there is an instruction:

1. Go to your vault's settings and seek for "community plugins" sector, if you have restricted mode, repeat first and second steps of official installation guide[^2];
2. If you have installed plugin and app saw it, you can see element named "UNITADE": open it and seek for setting named “extensions” and type an array of extensions, separated by comma;
3. Now, you can edit extensions which you typed in settings.

> Commentary: if you don't see other extensions exclude default obsidian's notes' extension (.MD), go to vault's settings, "Files & Links → Detect all file extensions" and now you can see any extensions file in your vault.
